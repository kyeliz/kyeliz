## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔍 I'm looking for my first internship or job opportunity in the Data Analaysis/Science field after graduating from a training program at BeCode
- 🌍 I'm based in Gent, Belgium
- 🌱 I’m learning Data Science, Machine learning and Data Analaysis
- 👯 I’d like to collaborate on interesting projects where I can learn a new things.
